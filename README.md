# Angular Utilities

These are some simple Angular utilities I developed for use on client and internal projects while working at White Lion Interactive.

## Confirm

A confirm dialog service that accepts an options object, an approval callback function and a denial callback function as an arguments.

## Growl

A growl message service that accepts an options object as an argument. Growl messages are useful for displaying responses to user actions outside of the flow of the page content.

## Loading

A loading service that accepts an options object as an argument. It triggers a global loading spinner, with the option to display a message within the loading element, as well.

_Note: This repo is for code review (read-only) purposes. The component relies on dependencies that are not not included in this project._
